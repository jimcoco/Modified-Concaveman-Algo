# Modified-Concaveman-Algo
A modified version of concaveman algorithm for convex hull building. Convex hull building is a crucial last step for a tree segmentation process which helps to analyse individual point clouds in a more efficient way. Modified concaveman algorithm improves the flexibility in the parameter tuning for user to have a more advanced modification inside the tree segementation program.
